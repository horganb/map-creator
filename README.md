This app allows users to create maps of any sort, and give viewing access to clients. A map consists of one or more images, as well as tags (or "pins") that describe items in the image. It can be used to create locational maps (amusement parks, etc.), food maps (catering, charcuterie boards, etc.), educational maps (anatomy, geography, etc.), and many other helpful tools. Both the editor and viewer are mobile friendly. Take a look!
